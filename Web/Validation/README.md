# Internal Description
- For this one here, all they need to do is put javascript into the submission that will call out to a server, and give them the flag. This challange does require control of a public IP address, which many teams will not have. I anticipate a great deal of bitching as a result of this.

# Solution
- In pwn.txt

# Flag
- flag{Validation_feels_good_doesnt_it}
